TrackStar is the culmination of my two year adventure learning CAD, embedded programming and PCB design. In 2018 I moved to France with my wife for her job and between French
classes and job application I've still found myself with more free-time than I've ever had so I took the opportunity to learn some embedded programming with 
Arduino. Then Covid-19 hit and suddenly I wasn't even allowed to leave the house so I decided to complete the astrophotography mount I was dabbling with.
Five-plus redesigns of the mount and the PCB and I'm ready to release TrackStar, so I built this site.
