TrackStar is the culmination of my two year adventure in learning CAD, embedded programming and PCB design. In 2018 I moved to France with my wife for her job. I spoke no French 
and enrolled in full time French courses hoping I could learn French and get a job quickly. Four semester came and went and I had a piece of paper that said I as fluent but 
in the few interviews I could get, it became apparent pretty quickly that I wasn't fluent enough for any jobs I was willing to do. All during this time I was learning arduino 
as a gateway to do some programming. Then Covid-19 hit and suddenly I wasn't even allowed to leave the house so I decided to complete the astrophotography mount I was dabbling with. Five-plus redesigns of the mount 
and the PCB and I'm ready to release TrackStar, so built this site.
